Your code will be graded by compiling the code with the -O2 flag (see makefile)
and running the code like this:

./ngramfast -g

./ngramstl -g

Note that ngramfast is built from NgramFast.C/NgramFast.h and ngramstl
is built from NgramSTL.C/NgramSTL.h 

If you create other implementations that you want to be graded 
instead of these two, you need to indicate those in this file.  
To add those, you'll need to modify main.C and the makefile to include 
your other implementations.  Of the implementations that you choose
to be graded, one should use the C++ STL and the others should not.
